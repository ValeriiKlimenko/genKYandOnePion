# genKYandOnePion
EG is based on:
1) at Q2 < 5GeV2 interpolation of the available CLAS data 
2) at Q2 > 5GeV2 extrapolation of the available CLAS data that is based on Operator Product Expansion 

Requirments: Cern root.

Using (if you are using executable file skip following steps: 2-4):

1) install root (https://root.cern.ch/building-root) or type command: use root/6.10.02
2) git clone of the EG: git clone https://github.com/ValeriiKlimenko/genKYandOnePion/ 
3) Then type command: chmod +x COMPILE_eg_ky
4) To compile: ./COMPILE_eg_ky
5) setenv dataPATH /WAY/TO/THE/DATA/FOLDER

Here is an example for my local PC, do not copy this command: 
setenv dataPATH /home/CLAS12/EG/data

6) to run exe file: ./eg_ky arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5 arg6 arg7 arg8

To set the parameters use arg1-arg8
 Its format is as follows.
 - arg1 is the string "KLambda" or "KSigma" or "Pi0P" or "PiN"
 - arg2 is Ebeam that should be >0 and less than 12GeV (Energy of the beam)
 - arg3 and arg4 contain two numbers Q2min and Q2max.
   This is the range in Q2, where the events will be generated.
 - arg5 and arg6 are two numbers Wmin and Wmax.
   This is the range in W, where the events will be generated.
   Wmin more then zero (GeV); (if Wmin less than treshold, treshold value will be used)
   Wmax less then 4 GeV;
 - arg7 is the number of events to be generated.
 - arg8 is the name of the output file.
 
 An example: ./eg_ky KSigma 11. 2. 11.999 1.5 4.0 5000 lund_KS.lund
	
The output will be a lund file with the name that you set in outputFileName variable.
